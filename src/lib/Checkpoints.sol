/**
 * @dev This library defines the `History` struct, for checkpointing values as they change at different points in
 * time, and later looking up past values by block timestamp.
 *
 * To create a history of checkpoints define a variable type `Checkpoints.History` in your contract, and store a new
 * checkpoint for the current transaction timestamp using the {push} function.
 *
 * @dev This was created by modifying then running the OpenZeppelin `Checkpoints.js` script, which generated a version
 * of this library that uses a 64 bit `timestamp` and 128 bit `quantity` field in the `Checkpoint` struct. The struct
 * was then modified to add a 64 bit `expiration` field. For simplicity, safe cast and math methods were inlined from
 * the OpenZeppelin versions at the same commit. We disable forge-fmt for this file to simplify diffing against the
 * original OpenZeppelin version: https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/d00acef4059807535af0bd0dd0ddf619747a044b/contracts/utils/Checkpoints.sol
