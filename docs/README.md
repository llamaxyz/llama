# Overview

## Securing smart contract governance

Llama is an onchain governance and access control framework. Projects can use the factory contract to permissionessly deploy independent, self-governed instances. These instances contain a core contract for managing the action process from creation to execution, a non-transferable NFT contract that encodes roles and permissions for policyholders, and modular strategies to define action execution rules.
